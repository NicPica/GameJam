  title: The Weight of Want
  loreText: 'You carried more than the others.

    You deserved more than the others.

    The
    dark simply chose the slowest.

    

    No one said you had to wait.

    No
    one said you had to turn back.

    Silence is not the same as accusation.

    

    Three
    objects remain.

    They were lighter once.

    The entrance is the exit.'
