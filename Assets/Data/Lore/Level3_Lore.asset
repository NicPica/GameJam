  title: The Door You Closed
  loreText: "It wasn\u2019t that monster that closed the path.\r\nIt was the door.\r\nIt
    was your hand.\r\n\r\nThe amulet was warm when you took it.\r\nThe bracelet tightened
    when you ran.\r\nThe talisman opened inward.\r\n\r\nYou are not searching for
    treasure.\r\nYou are searching for the moment before it happened.\r\nThe entrance
    is the exit."
