  loreText: 'There was time to stay.

    There was time to turn.

    There was
    time.

    

    The dungeon did not swallow you.

    You stepped inside
    something smaller.

    A choice.

    

    The amulet.

    The bracelet.

    The
    talisman.

    

    You have gathered them before.

    

    There is no
    deeper chamber.

    There is no final door.

    The entrance is the exit.'
